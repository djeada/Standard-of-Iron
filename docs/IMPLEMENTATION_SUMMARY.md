3. **docs/AUDIO_INTEGRATION.md** (159 lines, new file)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the integration

## Implementation Details

### 1. AudioSystem Initialization (Lines 160-188)
- Initialize singleton AudioSystem
- Load audio resources from `assets/audio/`
- Create and initialize AudioEventHandler
- Configure unit voice mappings (archer, knight, spearman)
- Configure ambient music mappings (peaceful, tense, combat, victory, defeat)

### 2. Update Loop Integration (Line 520)
- Call `updateAmbientState(dt)` during each update
- Runs only when not paused or loading
- Check interval: 2 seconds (not every frame)

### 3. Ambient State Tracking (Lines 1540-1593)
Determines game state based on:
- Victory/defeat conditions (highest priority)
- Active combat (player units attacking or enemies nearby)
- Tense state (both players have barracks)
- Peaceful state (default)

Publishes `AmbientStateChangedEvent` when state changes.

### 4. Combat Detection (Lines 1595-1630)
- Checks if player units have attack targets
- Spatial check for enemies within 15 unit radius
- Uses distance squared to avoid sqrt() overhead
- Returns true if any combat detected

### 5. Audio Resource Loading (Lines 1632-1689)
Loads from `assets/audio/`:
- **Voices**: archer_voice.wav, knight_voice.wav, spearman_voice.wav
- **Music**: peaceful.wav, tense.wav, combat.wav, victory.wav, defeat.wav

Uses QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() for portable path resolution.

### 6. Clean Shutdown (Lines 258-264)
- Shutdown AudioEventHandler
- Shutdown AudioSystem singleton
- Ensures no hanging threads

### 7. Initial State Setup (Lines 980-996)
When starting a new skirmish:
- Reset ambient state to PEACEFUL
- Reset timer
- Trigger initial peaceful music event

## Event Flow

```
GameEngine Constructor
  ├─> AudioSystem::getInstance().initialize()
  ├─> loadAudioResources()
  └─> AudioEventHandler->initialize()
        └─> Subscribe to game events

GameEngine::update(dt)
  └─> updateAmbientState(dt)
        └─> Publish AmbientStateChangedEvent (if changed)
              └─> AudioEventHandler receives event
                    └─> AudioSystem plays appropriate music

Unit Selected (SelectionSystem)
  └─> Publish UnitSelectedEvent
        └─> AudioEventHandler receives event
              └─> AudioSystem plays unit voice

GameEngine Destructor
  ├─> AudioEventHandler->shutdown()
  └─> AudioSystem::getInstance().shutdown()
```

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
1. **Thread-based audio**: Audio processing doesn't block game loop
2. **Infrequent checks**: Ambient state checked every 2 seconds, not every frame
3. **Event-driven**: Audio responds to events, no continuous polling
4. **Optimized combat detection**: Uses distance squared, early exits
5. **No new game systems**: Leverages existing event infrastructure

### Memory Impact
- One `unique_ptr<AudioEventHandler>` (~8 bytes)
- Two state variables (enum + float, ~8 bytes)
- Audio resources loaded once at startup
- Total: < 20 bytes of new member data

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] AudioSystem initializes successfully
- [x] AudioEventHandler initializes successfully
- [x] Audio resources are loaded
- [x] Unit selection triggers appropriate voice sounds
- [x] Ambient music changes based on game state
- [x] Clean shutdown with no hanging threads
- [x] No impact on frame rate
- [x] Game stability maintained

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Audio plays in response to real in-game events**
   - Unit selection events trigger voice sounds
   - Ambient state changes trigger music

✅ **System initializes and shuts down correctly with the game**
   - AudioSystem and AudioEventHandler initialized in constructor
   - Both shut down cleanly in destructor

✅ **Audio system has no impact on frame rate or game stability**
   - Thread-based processing
   - Infrequent ambient state checks (2 second interval)
   - Event-driven architecture
   - No blocking operations in game loop

## Notes

- The existing AudioSystem and AudioEventHandler classes were already well-designed
- Integration required minimal changes (only game_engine.h/cpp modified)
- No changes to existing game systems were necessary
- Event system provided clean integration points
- Audio files already existed in assets/audio/
