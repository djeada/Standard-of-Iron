# Standard of Iron - RTS Game

A modern real-time strategy (RTS) game built with C++20, Qt 6, and OpenGL 3.3 Core. Command archers and barracks in tactical battles with complete unit control, production systems, and victory conditions.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Unit Production**: Build archers from barracks with production queues
- **Rally Points**: Set spawn locations for newly produced units (visual yellow flags)
- **Combat System**: Ranged archer combat with health bars and visual arrow projectiles
- **AI Opponents**: Computer-controlled enemy that produces units and attacks your base
- **Victory/Defeat**: Win by destroying the enemy barracks, lose if yours is destroyed
- **Team Colors**: Visual distinction between player (blue) and enemy (red) units

### Advanced Unit Commands
- **Move**: Right-click to move selected units to a location
- **Attack**: Use Attack command to force units to target enemies
- **Stop**: Halt all unit actions immediately
- **Patrol**: Set two waypoints for units to patrol (green flags), auto-engaging nearby enemies
- **Formation Planning**: Units automatically spread into formations when given group movement orders

### Selection & Control
- **Click Selection**: Click individual units or buildings
- **Area Selection**: Drag to select multiple units in a rectangle
- **Additive Selection**: Hold Shift to add to current selection
- **Smart Selection**: Selection system filters out dead units automatically
- **Selection Feedback**: Blue selection rings on selected units, hover rings on buildings

### Visual Systems
- **3D Rendering**: OpenGL-based rendering with custom shaders
- **Unit Visuals**: Distinct archer models with team-colored details
- **Building Visuals**: Detailed barracks with banners and production indicators
- **Health Bars**: Visible health for all units and buildings
- **Flag Markers**: Rally points (yellow) and patrol waypoints (green)
- **Arrow VFX**: Animated arrow projectiles with arcing trajectories
- **Terrain Grid**: Optional grid overlay for tactical planning

### Camera System
- **Free Movement**: WASD or arrow keys to pan camera
- **Rotation**: Q/E keys to rotate view
- **Elevation**: R/F keys to adjust height
- **Follow Mode**: Camera follows selected units (optional)
- **Edge Scrolling**: Move mouse to screen edges to pan
- **Smart UI Detection**: Edge scrolling disabled over HUD elements

### User Interface

### Map Configuration
- **Data-Driven Victory Conditions**: Configure win/loss conditions via map JSON files
- **Flexible Game Modes**: Support for elimination, survive time, and custom objectives
- **Key Structure Definitions**: Specify which buildings must be protected or destroyed
- **Map-Specific Rules**: Different maps can have unique victory conditions without engine changes

### Engine Architecture
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Flexible game object system with templated components
- **Event System**: Type-safe event management with subscription/publishing
- **Serialization**: JSON-based world and entity persistence
- **Multi-System Architecture**: Separate systems for AI, combat, movement, pathfinding, patrol, production
- **VictoryService**: Standalone service for managing victory/defeat conditions with event-based monitoring

## Requirements

- **C++20** compatible compiler (GCC 10+ or Clang 11+)
- **Qt 6.4+** with Quick, OpenGL modules

## How to Play

### Objective
Destroy the enemy barracks while protecting your own.

### Basic Strategy
1. **Build Archers**: Select your barracks and recruit archers
2. **Set Rally Point**: Right-click with barracks selected to set spawn location
3. **Gather Forces**: Let archers accumulate at rally point
4. **Attack**: Select archers, click Attack, then click enemy barracks
5. **Defend**: Keep producing units to defend against enemy attacks

### Advanced Tactics
- **Patrol Routes**: Set up patrols to automatically defend areas
- **Formation Attacks**: Select multiple units before attacking for better damage
- **Rally Management**: Position rally points strategically (safe but close to action)
- **Production Timing**: Don't let your barracks sit idle
- **Resource Management**: Each barracks can only have 10 units maximum

## Architecture Overview

### Entity-Component-System
The engine uses a modern ECS architecture where:
- **Entities** are unique IDs representing game objects
- **Components** store data (Transform, Renderable, Unit, Movement, Health, Patrol, etc.)
- **Systems** process entities with specific component combinations each frame

### Key Components
- `TransformComponent`: Position, rotation, scale
- `UnitComponent`: Health, owner, unit type, speed, damage
- `MovementComponent`: Target position, pathfinding data
- `PatrolComponent`: Waypoints, patrol state
- `AttackTargetComponent`: Target entity, chase behavior
- `ProductionComponent`: Queue, timer, rally point
- `BuildingComponent`: Building-specific data

### Game Systems (Update Order)
1. **ArrowSystem**: Updates arrow VFX projectiles
2. **MovementSystem**: Moves units, executes pathfinding
3. **PatrolSystem**: Manages patrol routes, detects enemies
4. **CombatSystem**: Processes attacks, applies damage
5. **AISystem**: Controls enemy behavior
6. **ProductionSystem**: Handles unit spawning
7. **SelectionSystem**: Manages selection state

### Rendering Pipeline
1. **Scene Setup**: Camera matrices and viewport
2. **Ground Rendering**: Terrain with optional grid
3. **Entity Rendering**: All units and buildings (via entity-specific renderers)
4. **Arrow VFX**: Projectile effects
5. **Patrol Flags**: Waypoint markers (green) and rally points (yellow)
6. **UI Overlay**: HUD, selection indicators, health bars

## Extending the Game

### Adding New Unit Types
1. Create unit definition in `game/units/`
2. Add renderer in `render/entity/`
3. Register in entity renderer registry
4. Add to production service (optional)

### Creating Custom Commands
```cpp
// In game_engine.h
Q_INVOKABLE void onMyCommand(qreal sx, qreal sy);

// In game_engine.cpp
void GameEngine::onMyCommand(qreal sx, qreal sy) {
    // Convert screen to world coordinates
    QVector3D hit;
    if (!screenToGround(QPointF(sx, sy), hit)) return;
    
    // Issue command to selected units
    const auto& selected = m_selectionSystem->getSelectedUnits();
    for (auto id : selected) {
        // Process command...
    }
}
```

### Adding UI Elements
Edit QML files in `ui/qml/` to add new buttons, panels, or overlays.

### Configuring Victory Conditions
Maps can define custom victory and defeat conditions in their JSON files. Add a `"victory"` section:

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Map",
  "victory": {
    "type": "elimination",
    "key_structures": ["barracks", "HQ"],
    "defeat_conditions": ["no_key_structures"]
  },
  ...
}
```

**Victory Types:**
- `"elimination"`: Destroy all enemy key structures to win
- `"survive_time"`: Survive for a specified duration (use `"duration"` in seconds)

**Defeat Conditions:**
- `"no_key_structures"`: Lose if all your key structures are destroyed
- `"no_units"`: Lose if you have no units remaining

**Example: Survival Mode**
```json
"victory": {
  "type": "survive_time",
  "duration": 600,
  "defeat_conditions": ["no_units"]
}
```

**Example: Headquarters Defense**
```json
"victory": {
  "type": "elimination",
  "key_structures": ["HQ", "barracks"],
  "defeat_conditions": ["no_key_structures"]
}
```
