# Audio Event System Integration - Summary

## Overview
This implementation connects the audio system to the game's event system, enabling automatic audio responses to game events such as unit selection and ambient state changes.

## Files Created

### Core Implementation
1. **game/audio/AudioEventHandler.h** - Header for the audio event handler
2. **game/audio/AudioEventHandler.cpp** - Implementation of audio event handling
3. **test_audio_event_handler.cpp** - Basic unit test for event handler
4. **test_audio_integration.cpp** - Integration test with full game systems

### Placeholder Audio Assets
Created placeholder WAV files for testing:
- **assets/audio/voices/** - Unit voice lines (archer, knight, spearman)
- **assets/audio/music/** - Background music tracks (peaceful, tense, combat, victory, defeat)

## Files Modified

### Build Configuration
- **CMakeLists.txt** - Added test executables for audio testing
- **game/audio/CMakeLists.txt** - Added AudioEventHandler to build, linked engine_core

### Event Integration
- **game/systems/selection_system.cpp** - Added UnitSelectedEvent publishing when units are selected

### Documentation
- **game/audio/README.md** - Comprehensive documentation of audio system and event integration

## Features Implemented

### 1. Audio Event Handler
- Subscribes to game events via EventManager
- Maps unit types to voice line sounds
- Maps ambient states to background music
- Handles generic audio/music trigger events

### 2. Unit Selection Audio
- When a unit is selected, the corresponding voice line plays automatically
- Unit type → sound mapping: archer, knight, spearman
- Event flow: SelectionSystem → UnitSelectedEvent → AudioEventHandler → AudioSystem

### 3. Ambient State Music
- Background music changes based on game state
- State → music mapping: PEACEFUL, TENSE, COMBAT, VICTORY, DEFEAT
- Event flow: Game Logic → AmbientStateChangedEvent → AudioEventHandler → AudioSystem

### 4. Direct Audio Triggers
- AudioTriggerEvent for manual sound playback
- MusicTriggerEvent for manual music playback
- Full control over volume, looping, priority, crossfade

### 5. Resource Loading System
- AudioSystem supports loading WAV files
- Simple API: loadSound(id, path) and loadMusic(id, path)
- Resources loaded once, played many times

## Testing

### test_audio_event_handler
Tests basic event handler functionality:
- Handler initialization and shutdown
- Event subscription registration
- Resource loading
- Event publishing and handling
- Statistics verification

**Result**: ✓ All tests pass

### test_audio_integration
Tests full integration with game systems:
- World and entity creation
- Unit component setup
- Selection system integration
- Unit selection → voice playback
- Ambient state changes → music switching
- Event statistics validation

**Result**: ✓ All tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Triggering test game events plays appropriate audio**
- Verified via test_audio_integration
- Unit selection plays correct voice lines
- State changes play correct music

✅ **AudioEventHandler correctly registers and unregisters from event system**
- Verified via test_audio_event_handler
- Subscription counts validated
- Clean shutdown without leaks

✅ **Resource loader can locate and load placeholder sounds**
- Verified via both tests
- All placeholder files successfully loaded
- Audio files created in proper directory structure

## Architecture

### Event Flow
```
Game Event → EventManager.publish() → AudioEventHandler.onEvent() → AudioSystem.play()
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **World Pointer in Handler**: AudioEventHandler requires a World pointer to look up entity data when handling UnitSelectedEvent. This allows it to determine unit type from entity ID.

2. **ScopedEventSubscription**: Used for automatic cleanup of event subscriptions when the handler is destroyed.

3. **Thread Safety**: AudioSystem runs playback on a dedicated thread; all public methods are thread-safe.

4. **Minimal Changes**: Only modified SelectionSystem to publish events; no changes to existing audio playback logic.

## Future Enhancements

The following were identified but not implemented (as per minimal change requirement):

- 3D positional audio
- Audio occlusion
- Dynamic music layers
- Voice line queuing
- Audio resource hot-reloading
- More sophisticated ambient state transitions

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build everything
make build

# Run basic test
./build/test_audio_event_handler

# Run integration test
./build/test_audio_integration
```

## Notes

- Audio playback may not be audible in headless CI environments (PulseAudio warnings are expected)
- Placeholder audio files are simple sine waves; replace with actual game audio
- All code follows existing project style (clang-format applied)
- No breaking changes to existing systems
