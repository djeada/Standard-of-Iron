# Arena gameplay scenarios

Arena scenarios use the production `World`, registered runtime systems, unit
factories, command service, humanoid preparation, and OpenGL renderer. The same
scenario catalog is available interactively, from a local batch command, and to
the programmatic test harness.

## Interactive inspection

```bash
build-debug/bin/arena_app --scenario spear_walk_contact

# Settlement and economy inspection
build-debug/bin/arena_app --scenario roman_marching_camp
build-debug/bin/arena_app --scenario carthage_trade_town
build-debug/bin/arena_app --scenario rival_economies
```

This loads the named catalog scenario directly and runs it at real wall-clock
speed for visual inspection. Running without `--scenario` still opens the
general Arena UI; use the **Units** panel to choose and load scenarios. The
status bar reports the first automated failure and final PASS/FAIL result while
the viewport remains available for normal RTS camera controls.

## Local batch inspection

Batch mode intentionally opens the real Arena OpenGL window. It requires a
local graphical session and is not installed as a CI test.

```bash
# List the catalog
build/bin/arena_app --list-scenarios

# Run one scenario
build-debug/bin/arena_app \
  --batch \
  --scenario spear_walk_contact \
  --fps 60 \
  --seed 1337 \
  --artifact-dir artifacts/arena

# Run the complete local catalog
build/bin/arena_app --batch --all --artifact-dir artifacts/arena
```

The command exits with status `0` only when every selected scenario passes,
`1` for gameplay/render failures or watchdog timeouts, and `2` for invalid
arguments. Each scenario directory contains:

- `report.json`: machine-readable acceptance results and exact offenders.
- `trace.jsonl`: frame-by-frame entity and rendered-soldier observations.
- `run_config.json`: scenario, seed, fixed FPS, and renderer configuration.
- `final.png`: the final rendered framebuffer for visual inspection.
- `failure_frame.png` or `timeout.png` when applicable. Continuous context is
  retained in `trace.jsonl` without forcing extra OpenGL paints between fixed
  verification frames.

The `--duration` option can shorten a diagnostic run, but the catalog defaults
should be used for acceptance runs because contact and retargeting expectations
need time to complete.

## Programmatic tests

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen \
  build/bin/standard_of_iron_tests \
  --gtest_filter='ArenaScenario*'
```

These tests validate the catalog schema, named-group orchestration, event
triggers, production command shape, rendered-root acceptance checks, and local
artifact serialization. Actual rendered acceptance is performed by the batch
command above.

## Settlement and economy contracts

Settlement scenes use the production building factory and nation renderers, so
changes to homes, markets, barracks, walls, and towers appear exactly as they do
in-game.

- `roman_marching_camp` uses an axial castrum composition: central principia,
  barracks street, ordered housing, perimeter walls, and watchtowers.
- `carthage_trade_town` uses dense Punic courtyard housing around a market,
  with a fortified mercantile quarter and warm brick-and-cedar materials.
- `rival_economies` gives Roman and Carthaginian AI builders equivalent starter
  settlements with finite stockpiles plus authored olive groves, stone, and iron.
  Builders must harvest missing materials and then complete construction. Roman
  AI uses a defensive camp plan; Carthaginian AI uses a compact economic plan.

Batch runs produce the normal report, trace, and framebuffer artifacts.
`GroupExists` expectations protect required settlement anchors;
`OwnerHarvestsResource` and `OwnerCompletesConstruction` prove the full economic
loop, while the shared frame-budget contract catches overly expensive detail.

## Formation melee contract

`spear_walk_contact` is the rendered regression contract for formation melee.
It fails when any of these rules are violated:

- Formation roots lock only after deep formation overlap, not first-rank contact.
- Every living soldier receives an opponent lane and is observed in a fight
  animation during the engagement.
- Per-soldier fight phases must contain visible deterministic staggering.
- A melee lock cannot disappear, change target, navigate, translate, or rotate
  while the locked opponent remains alive.
- Pose oscillation, root teleporting, unexpected fall poses, and frame-budget
  regressions remain failures.

The trace records unit yaw and lock target plus each soldier's declared action,
opponent slot, engagement gap, visual state, and attack phase. This lets CLI and
LLM inspection verify the same presentation contract consumed by the renderer.
