# Quick Reference: Grass Rendering Changes

## What Changed?

Two shader files were enhanced to add visual variety to grass/terrain:

### `ground_plane.frag` (flat ground)
- Added moisture variation across terrain (large patches)
- Added occasional mud/bare patches (sparse, dark areas)
- Surface roughness now varies with moisture
- Subtle color shifting for depth

### `terrain_chunk.frag` (hills/mountains)  
- Same moisture and mud systems
- Mud patches avoid steep slopes
- Consistent with flat ground appearance

## Visual Result

**Before:** Uniform green grass everywhere  
**After:** Natural variation with wet/dry patches and occasional mud

## Technical Details

### Added Features (both shaders)

1. **Moisture Noise**
   ```glsl
   float moistureNoise = fbm(position * 1.8x);
   ```
   - Medium-scale visible patches across terrain
   - Affects dryness (+25%), roughness (-25%), brightness (Â±8%)

2. **Mud Patches**
   ```glsl
   float mudPatch = smoothstep(0.72, 0.80, noise);
   ```
   - Visible coverage (~15-20% on flats)
   - 25% darker than soil
   - Strong blending (75%)

3. **Variable Roughness**
   ```glsl
   microAmp = 0.12 * (1.0 - moisture * 0.25);
   ```
   - Wet = smoother surface
   - Dry = rougher surface

4. **Hue Variation**
   ```glsl
   hueShift = (moisture - 0.5) * 0.08;  // ground plane
   hueShift = (moisture - 0.5) * 0.06;  // terrain
   ```
   - Â±8% (ground) / Â±6% (terrain) brightness variation
   - Clearly visible depth perception

## Performance

- **Cost:** ~3-5% fragment shader time
- **Memory:** 0 bytes (no new uniforms/textures)
- **Method:** 2 additional noise samples per pixel

## Tuning Parameters

If you need to adjust the effect, edit these values in the shaders:

### Moisture Strength
```glsl
// Current: 0.25 (25% dryness increase in dry areas)
float dryness = clamp(... + 0.25 * (1.0 - moistureFactor), ...);
```
- Increase to 0.35 for stronger moisture effect
- Decrease to 0.15 for subtler effect

### Mud Patch Coverage
```glsl
// Current: 0.72-0.80 (visible patches ~15-20%)
float mudPatch = smoothstep(0.72, 0.80, patchNoise);
```
- Lower to 0.65-0.75 for more patches
- Raise to 0.78-0.85 for fewer patches

### Mud Patch Darkness & Strength
```glsl
// Current: 0.75 (25% darker) with 75% blend on ground, 65% on terrain
vec3 mudColor = u_soilColor * 0.75;
grassCol = mix(grassCol, mudColor, mudPatch * 0.75);
```
- Darker patches: 0.65 (35% darker) with 0.85 blend
- Lighter patches: 0.85 (15% darker) with 0.55 blend

### Hue Variation
```glsl
// Current: 0.08 (Â±8%) on ground, 0.06 (Â±6%) on terrain
float hueShift = (moistureNoise - 0.5) * 0.08;
```
- Increase to 0.12 for more color variation
- Decrease to 0.04 for subtler variation

## Testing Checklist

When you run the game, verify:

- [ ] Grass shows large-scale color variation (not uniform)
- [ ] Some areas look wetter/greener, others drier/yellower
- [ ] Occasional darker patches visible on flat areas
- [ ] Patches blend smoothly (no hard edges)
- [ ] Hills/terrain match flat ground style
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] No visual artifacts or glitches

## Troubleshooting

**Too strong / "splotchy":**
- Reduce moisture strength (0.15 â†’ 0.10)
- Reduce mud blend (0.6 â†’ 0.4)
- Reduce hue shift (0.03 â†’ 0.02)

**Too weak / barely visible:**
- Increase moisture strength (0.15 â†’ 0.20)
- Lower mud threshold (0.75 â†’ 0.70)
- Increase hue shift (0.03 â†’ 0.05)

**Patches too harsh:**
- Widen smoothstep range (0.75-0.82 â†’ 0.73-0.85)
- Reduce blend strength (0.6 â†’ 0.5)

**Performance issues:**
- Remove hue variation (comment out hueShift lines)
- Use noise21 instead of fbm for moisture (less accurate but faster)
