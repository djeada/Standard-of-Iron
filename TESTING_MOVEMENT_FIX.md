# Testing Guide: Movement Fix Validation

## Overview
This guide helps validate the fixes for incorrect movement behavior when issuing consecutive move commands.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Units moving in wrong direction on consecutive commands**
   - Root cause: Velocity not cleared when new path requested
   - Fix: Clear vx, vz immediately when submitting new pathfinding request

2. **Jitter during path transitions**
   - Root cause: Old velocity persisted while new path was being computed
   - Fix: Clear velocity before applying new path in processPathResults

3. **Group movement causing units near destination to move backward**
   - Root cause: All units were repathed even if already at destination
   - Fix: Skip repathfinding for units within 1.0 units of their target

## Manual Testing Procedure

### Test 1: Consecutive Move Commands (Single Unit)
1. Start the game and select a single unit
2. Issue a move command to a distant location (e.g., 20+ units away)
3. While the unit is moving, immediately issue a new move command to a different direction
4. **Expected**: Unit should immediately stop and reorient toward the new target
5. **Expected**: No backward or sideways movement should occur
6. **Expected**: Movement should be smooth without jitter

### Test 2: Rapid Command Changes
1. Select a single unit
2. Rapidly issue 3-4 move commands in quick succession to different locations
3. **Expected**: Unit should respond to each command without erratic movement
4. **Expected**: No oscillation or back-and-forth movement
5. **Expected**: Final destination should match the last command issued

### Test 3: Group Movement - Near Destination Units
1. Select a group of 5-10 units scattered at different distances from a target
2. Issue a group move command to a location
3. Wait for some units to reach or get very close to the destination
4. While some units are still far away, issue another group move command nearby
5. **Expected**: Units already at or near destination should not move backward
6. **Expected**: Only units far from target should path to new location
7. **Expected**: Formation should not cause backward "balancing" movement

### Test 4: AI-Controlled Units
1. Start a skirmish with AI opponents
2. Observe AI unit movement patterns
3. **Expected**: AI units should move smoothly without erratic direction changes
4. **Expected**: No visible backward movement when AI issues new commands

## Verification Points

### Code Changes
- [x] `command_service.cpp:266-267`: Velocity reset on new pathfinding request
- [x] `command_service.cpp:597-599`: Velocity cleared before new path applied
- [x] `command_service.cpp:421-429`: Near-destination check in group movement

### Behavior Checks
- [ ] No wrong-direction movement on consecutive commands
- [ ] No jitter or oscillation during movement
- [ ] Smooth transitions between old and new paths
- [ ] Group units near destination don't move backward
- [ ] Works for both player and AI-controlled units

## Performance Notes

The fixes add minimal computational overhead:
- Two float assignments (vx=0, vz=0) per command
- One distance check per unit in group movement (only during command issuance)
- No impact on steady-state movement performance

## Regression Testing

Ensure existing movement behavior still works:
- [ ] Direct paths (short distances) still work
- [ ] Pathfinding around obstacles still works
- [ ] Attack-move commands still work
- [ ] Patrol commands still work
- [ ] Formation movement still works (without backward balancing)
